Data Structure
---------------
- object has:
	- geometry
		- Geometry definition differs for different data types
	- tags
		- list of key/value pairs

Elements
---------
There are three basic types of elements which can have one or more tags. They are:
1. Node
2. Way
3. Relation

### Node ![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/7/76/Osm_element_node.svg/20px-Osm_element_node.svg.png)
- represents a specific point or point of interest on the earth's surface 
- consists at least an id number and a pair of coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- are also used to define the shape of a way

### Way![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/e/ee/Osm_element_way.svg/20px-Osm_element_way.svg.png) ![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/3/38/Osm_element_closedway.svg/20px-Osm_element_closedway.svg.png)![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/e/e6/Osm_element_area.svg/20px-Osm_element_area.svg.png)
	
- ordered list of nodes that define a polyline
- Represents:
	-  linear features as rivers and roads
	- boundaries of areas (solid polygons) such as a building or forest
		- a closed way, first node = last node
	- area with holes or boundaries having > 2000 nodes cannot be represented using a single way
		- a multipolygon relation data structure is needed
	- A way can be open or closed
	- Open way ![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/e/ee/Osm_element_way.svg/20px-Osm_element_way.svg.png)
		- way describing linear feature which does not share a first and last node
	- Closed way ![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/3/38/Osm_element_closedway.svg/20px-Osm_element_closedway.svg.png)![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/e/e6/Osm_element_area.svg/20px-Osm_element_area.svg.png)
		- one whose last node on the way is also the first node
		- may be interpreted as either a closed polyline or area
		- Area![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/e/e6/Osm_element_area.svg/20px-Osm_element_area.svg.png)
			- most closed ways are defined as areas even without tag area=yes

### Relation ![](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/4/48/Osm_element_relation.svg/20px-Osm_element_relation.svg.png)

- ordered list of one or more nodes, ways and/or relations as members
- members can have specific role within the relation	
- A multipurpose data structure that documents a relationship between two or more data elements (nodes, ways and/or relations)
-  Examples of relations:
	- Route
	- Turn restriction
	- multipolygon describing area with holes
- Meaning of relation should be derived from tag
- Elements within a relation can have a role within the relation
- Types of relation:

### Tag

- all types of elements (nodes, ways, relations) can have tags
- describe the meaning of the particular element to which they are attached
